**Adaptive Triggers Intro**
======
Adaptive Triggers are extremely useful for creating “responsive” applications, ones that adapt to the current screen size. This is necessary with Windows 10 because the same application can run on anything from a small phone up to a huge screen. This is the most exciting promise of Windows 10 (the same app running everywhere), but with it comes the necessity for the developer to focus on making his app responsive. With that said, this simple sample uses Adaptive Triggers to change the UI based on screen size and it's changes. You can find the full blog posts below.
