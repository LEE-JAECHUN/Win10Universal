<p>I am going to begin to focus a little deeper on mobile application development  with C#/XAML for the Windows platform.  As I began to focus my technical stuff there, I am going to be blogging, recording, and posting as much as I can, so that you can learn from all of the mistakes that I encounter along the way :)  My plan is to be more consistent with my online presence.  I plan to tie every blog post with a youtube and a sample project on GitHub.  I want to share EVERYTHING with you to make it as easy as possible to get started!  As a reference, you can get started learning skills for the beginning Windows developer here, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/quick_thoughts/archive/2015/04/25/preparing-for-universal-windows-development.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/quick_thoughts/archive/2015/04/25/preparing-for-universal-windows-development.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>You can download any of the sample projects in this repository and run on your local machine running Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015.</p>
