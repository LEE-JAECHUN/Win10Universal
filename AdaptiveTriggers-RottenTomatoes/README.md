**Adaptive Triggers With Rotten Tomatoes**
======
In Adaptive Triggers Intro we started from the very beginning with Adaptive Triggers.  We create a simple sample that displayed the current “state” (phone, tablet, of desktop) based on the width of the current screen.  Now, let’s take it one step further to create a more sophisticated that brings in information from the Rotten Tomatoes API and displays it differently according to screen size.  For a quick reference on the Rotten Tomatoes API, you can take a look, check the full post below.
